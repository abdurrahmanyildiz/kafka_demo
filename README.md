# kafka demo
This is the works that I have done for Apache Kafka.

The repository includes the only <b>spring boot part</b> for the kafka implementation. 
I mean this is a java project for kafka configurations (topics, producer, consumer configurations) and also listener implementation and the spring boot rest controller api(message controller).


If you want to use this structure you need to firstly download the kafka from: 
 <a href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.2.1/kafka_2.13-3.2.1.tgz" target="_blank">Download Apache Kafka</a>



Then navigate to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart" target="_blank" >Kafka QuickStart</a> and follow the instructions for quick start.
Please dont forget and consider that I am working on <b>Windows</b> machine.
