# kafkademo
My code works for Apache Kafka.

This is the repository of the result of amigos code sessions for kafka.

If you want to use this structure you need to firstly download the kafka from: 
https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.2.1/kafka_2.13-3.2.1.tgz

Then navigate to https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart and follow the instructions for quick start.
Please dont forget and consider that I am working on Windows machine.
